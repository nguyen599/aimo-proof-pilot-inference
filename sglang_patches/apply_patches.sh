# apply_patches.sh — apply the Olmo3Sink model + perf patches to the
# proof-pilot-env sglang venv (idempotent; originals backed up as *.orig).
#
# Patches (source in this dir -> target inside the venv's sglang/srt):
#   olmo2_sink_dflash.py        -> models/olmo2.py          REQUIRED: Olmo3Sink
#       target model — attention sinks computed in-kernel
#   dflash_sink.py              -> models/dflash.py         DFlash draft model
#       (speculative decoding; inert unless a draft model is served)
#   dflash_worker_v2_ring.py    -> speculative/dflash_worker_v2.py
#   fused_kv_materialize_fullnorm.py -> speculative/triton_ops/fused_kv_materialize.py
#   dflash_info_v2_swa_evict.py -> speculative/dflash_info_v2.py
#   patch_speculative_finish.py (script) earliest-stop handling and committed
#       KV-tail trimming for multi-token DFlash verify results
#   patch_canonical_greedy.py    canonical greedy near-tie resolution
#   patch_dflash_sampling.py    (script) reject unsupported probability
#       transforms and keep sampling uniforms off zero-probability boundaries
#   patch_w4a8_runtime_marker.py (script) log every successfully constructed
#       target Humming W4A8 layer and every W4A16 draft layer
#   patch_humming_target_scope.py (script) prevent the global target Humming
#       hook from converting the INT4 DFlash draft from W4A16 to W4A8
#   patch_humming_sm90_config.py (script) pin the H200 Humming helper to the
#       numerically verified M=256 kernel configuration for every row count
#
# Usage: bash apply_patches.sh <venv_path> [w4a8_helper_path]
#   w4a8_helper_path defaults to the in-image location and may also be supplied
#   as $W4A8_HELPER. Override it when the runtime lives somewhere other than
#   /workspace/pp (e.g. baked into the image at /opt/pp).
