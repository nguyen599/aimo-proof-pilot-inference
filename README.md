# AIMO Proof Pilot Inference

This repository runs the OPD-32B generate-verify-refine proof pipeline and its
strict GPT-5.6 Sol grader. The checked-in production configuration uses all
eight H200 GPUs as four TP2 replicas, with BF16 target and draft weights,
DFlash speculative decoding, and FlashAttention 3.

Follow this document in order on a clean machine. Commands assume the repository
is at `/workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference` and the prebuilt runtime is at
`/workspace/pp`.

## Production defaults

[`evaluation/configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml`](evaluation/configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml)
is the source of truth. Its current defaults are:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Hardware | 8 x NVIDIA H200 |
| Model | OPD-32B BF16 target and BF16 DFlash draft |
| Parallelism | TP2 x DP4 |
| Attention | FA3, page size 1, deterministic inference |
| Server context | 262,144 tokens |
| Server concurrency | 64 running requests per DP replica |
| Search concurrency | 96 requests cluster-wide |
| Search policy | 32 proofs, 16 verifications per proof, top 8, 4 refinements, up to 4 rounds |
| Sampling | temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95 |
| Prover/refiner segment | 65,536 tokens plus at most one 16,384-token forced solution continuation |
| Verifier continuation | at most one additional 16,384-token continuation |
| Final grader | 64 GPT-5.6 Sol attempts per proof, strict zero-veto aggregation |

Do not infer production settings from old run directories or historical test
scripts. Read the YAML before every run.

## 1. Prerequisites

You need all of the following before starting:

- Linux x86_64 with exactly eight visible H200 GPUs and an NVIDIA driver that
  supports the CUDA 13 runtime in the supplied environment.
- At least 100 GB of free local storage for the runtime, target model, draft
  model, logs, and evaluation artifacts.
- Git, `unzip`, `tar`, and network access to GitHub, Hugging Face, and the
  OpenAI API.
- The private `proof-pilot-env.zip` runtime archive from the project
  maintainers. It is not stored in this repository or in the Hugging Face model
  bundle. There is no supported PyPI-only replacement for this patched runtime.
- A Hugging Face token with access to
  `ycchen/proof-pilot-deploy-bundle`.
- An OpenAI API key with access and sufficient balance for `gpt-5.6-sol`.

The supplied runtime contains Python 3.12, CUDA 13 PyTorch, the custom SGLang
build, FlashInfer caches, and the Humming helper required by the repository
patches.

## 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bogoconic1/aimo-proof-pilot-inference.git \
  /workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
cd /workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference

export REPO=/workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
export VENV=/workspace/pp/venv
```

Use the same checkout and commit for server startup and evaluation. The evaluator
records the current commit and rejects a resume from a different one.

## 3. Configure credentials

Create `/workspace/.env` and keep it outside the repository:

```bash
cat > /workspace/.env <<'EOF'
HF_TOKEN="replace-with-your-hugging-face-token"
OPENAI_API_KEY="replace-with-your-openai-api-key"
EOF
chmod 600 /workspace/.env

set -a
source /workspace/.env
set +a
```

Never commit this file. A new terminal must source it again before downloading
models or running the full evaluator.

## 4. Install the prebuilt runtime

Start with empty `/workspace/pp` and `/workspace/proof-pilot-env-x` directories.
Replace the archive path below with the location supplied by the maintainers:

```bash
export ENV_ARCHIVE=/path/to/proof-pilot-env.zip

mkdir -p /workspace/proof-pilot-env-x /workspace/pp
unzip -q "$ENV_ARCHIVE" -d /workspace/proof-pilot-env-x
tar -xzf /workspace/proof-pilot-env-x/proof-pilot-env.bin \
  -C /workspace/pp --strip-components=1

sed -i 's|^home = .*|home = /workspace/pp/pybase/bin|' \
  /workspace/pp/venv/pyvenv.cfg

mkdir -p "$HOME/.cache/flashinfer" "$HOME/.humming/cache"
cp -rn /workspace/pp/flashinfer_cache/. "$HOME/.cache/flashinfer/"
```

Install the repository's pinned evaluation dependencies, then apply its SGLang
patch set. Apply the patches after dependency installation so a package update
cannot overwrite them:

```bash
cd "$REPO"
uv pip install --python "$VENV/bin/python" \
  -r evaluation/requirements.txt
bash sglang_patches/apply_patches.sh "$VENV"
```

The patch command is idempotent. Re-run it whenever the environment's SGLang
installation is replaced or upgraded.

## 5. Download the BF16 models

The production YAML expects these exact local paths:

```bash
set -a
source /workspace/.env
set +a

"$VENV/bin/hf" download ycchen/proof-pilot-deploy-bundle \
  --include 'opd-32b-deploy/*' \
  --include 'dflash-32b-draft-v2test-phaseL/*' \
  --local-dir /workspace/models
```

Confirm the required files and GPU count before launching:

```bash
test -f /workspace/models/opd-32b-deploy/config.json
test -f /workspace/models/dflash-32b-draft-v2test-phaseL/config.json
test "$(nvidia-smi -L | wc -l)" -eq 8

"$VENV/bin/python" - <<'PY'
import openai
import torch

print("OpenAI SDK:", openai.__version__)
print("PyTorch:", torch.__version__)
print("Visible GPUs:", torch.cuda.device_count())
assert tuple(int(x) for x in openai.__version__.split(".")[:2]) >= (2, 45)
assert torch.cuda.device_count() == 8
assert all("H200" in torch.cuda.get_device_name(i) for i in range(8))
PY
```

Do not continue if any command fails.

## 6. Start the production server

Use a dedicated terminal and keep it open. The evaluator validates markers from
the complete startup log, so write to a stable, non-rotating file rather than a
log that may be truncated by a service manager.

```bash
cd /workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
export REPO=/workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
export VENV=/workspace/pp/venv
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
export EVAL_SERVER_LOG=/workspace/opd32b-eval.log

: > "$EVAL_SERVER_LOG"
set -o pipefail
bash serve_opd32b.sh \
  --config evaluation/configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml \
  2>&1 | tee "$EVAL_SERVER_LOG"
```

Wait until the log reports that the SGLang server is ready. Do not start an
evaluation while models or CUDA graphs are still loading.

## 7. Validate the live server

Open a second terminal. This check compares the live SGLang server, model
metadata, all eight GPUs, and required DFlash startup markers with the YAML:

```bash
cd /workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
export REPO=/workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
export VENV=/workspace/pp/venv
export EVAL_SERVER_LOG=/workspace/opd32b-eval.log

"$VENV/bin/python" evaluation/harness/validate_server.py \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:30000 \
  --config evaluation/configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml \
  --output /tmp/opd32b-server-validation.json \
  --server-log "$EVAL_SERVER_LOG"
```

No output means validation passed. Inspect the recorded configuration with:

```bash
"$VENV/bin/python" -m json.tool /tmp/opd32b-server-validation.json | less
```

Do not run the evaluation against a server that fails validation.

## 8. Run IMO 2025 Problem 1

The full runner performs server preflight, proof search, artifact audits, strict
GPT-5.6 Sol grading, and report generation:

```bash
cd /workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
export VENV=/workspace/pp/venv
export EVAL_SERVER_LOG=/workspace/opd32b-eval.log
set -a
source /workspace/.env
set +a

RUN_ID="imo-2025-p1-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
"$VENV/bin/python" evaluation/harness/run_full_evaluation.py \
  --config evaluation/configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml \
  --ids-file evaluation/manifests/imo-2025-problem-1.json \
  --run-id "$RUN_ID"

echo "evaluation/runs/$RUN_ID/RESULT.md"
```

The final grader uses the MathArena problem-specific grading scheme from the
pinned dataset and the strict checked-in grader prompts. It does not use a
lenient alternate-method override.

## 9. Run all six IMO 2025 problems

Create one manifest and run the same production pipeline. Problems are processed
sequentially; the requests within each problem use the configured concurrency.

```bash
cd /workspace/aimo-proof-pilot-inference
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"dataset":"imo_2025","problem_ids":["1","2","3","4","5","6"]}' \
  > /tmp/imo-2025-all.json

export VENV=/workspace/pp/venv
export EVAL_SERVER_LOG=/workspace/opd32b-eval.log
set -a
source /workspace/.env
set +a

RUN_ID="imo-2025-all-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
"$VENV/bin/python" evaluation/harness/run_full_evaluation.py \
  --config evaluation/configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml \
  --ids-file /tmp/imo-2025-all.json \
  --run-id "$RUN_ID"
```

## 10. Resume an interrupted run

Run the exact same command with the same `--run-id`, config file, manifest file,
repository commit, model files, and prompts. Completed generation and grading
records are reused; missing or failed work is retried.

Do not edit or replace the YAML or manifest after a run starts. The evaluator
pins their hashes under the run directory and intentionally rejects mismatches.
For `/tmp/imo-2025-all.json`, recreate byte-for-byte identical content before
resuming.

## 11. Inspect results

Every run is written to `evaluation/runs/<run-id>/`:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `RESULT.md` | final score summary |
| `run_manifest.json` | pinned commit, inputs, hashes, model, search, and grader settings |
| `server_validation.json` | live server and GPU validation record |
| `generation/records.jsonl` | per-problem generation summary |
| `generation/problems/<id>/calls.jsonl` | every logical LLM call and request metadata |
| `generation/problems/<id>/rounds/` | round rankings and selections |
| `generation/problems/<id>/proofs/` | admitted proof artifacts |
| `grading/records.jsonl` | raw final-grader attempts |
| `grading/summary.json` | strict aggregated grades |

Evaluation directories can be very large. Do not commit them unless the result
is intentionally being published.

## 12. Change settings safely

Copy the production YAML to a clearly named file, edit that copy, and pass the
same path to both `serve_opd32b.sh` and `run_full_evaluation.py`. The validator
rejects a server whose TP/DP topology, attention backend, context, concurrency,
DFlash setup, or model mode differs from the selected YAML.

The server context is a total input-plus-output limit, not an output allowance.
Review [`evaluation/PIPELINE_REQUEST_SIZE.md`](evaluation/PIPELINE_REQUEST_SIZE.md)
before increasing generation lengths or prompt fan-in.

## 13. Stop the server

Press `Ctrl-C` in the server terminal. Confirm no model process still owns a GPU:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=gpu_uuid,pid,process_name,used_memory \
  --format=csv,noheader
```

## Troubleshooting

**`openai` is older than 2.45.0:** rerun the requirements installation with the
same `/workspace/pp/venv`, then reapply the SGLang patches.

**Server validation reports missing DFlash markers:** make sure
`EVAL_SERVER_LOG` points to the complete log from the current startup. Restart
the server into a freshly truncated, non-rotating log if the beginning is gone.

**CUDA device-count mismatch:** the production config requires exactly eight
visible GPUs because `TP x DP = 2 x 4`. Export all eight device IDs before
launching and stop any stale server first.

**A resume says an input differs:** restore the original commit, YAML, and
manifest or use a new run ID. Do not bypass the provenance check.

**The OpenAI grader fails before search:** verify that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is
exported, has `gpt-5.6-sol` access, and has available account balance.

## Architecture and additional workflows

- [`evaluation/EVALUATION_DESIGN.md`](evaluation/EVALUATION_DESIGN.md) defines
  ranking, selection, asynchronous verification, refinement, and resume
  semantics.
- [`evaluation/PIPELINE_REQUEST_SIZE.md`](evaluation/PIPELINE_REQUEST_SIZE.md)
  derives request payload and context sizes from first principles.
- [`dflash-kv-cache-architecture.md`](dflash-kv-cache-architecture.md) explains
  target KV, the draft ring, radix-prefix reuse, and DFlash verification.
- [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) documents the isolated DFlash and KV-cache
  experiments. Test settings are not production settings.
- [`evaluation/legacy-six-problem/`](evaluation/legacy-six-problem/) preserves the
  older six-problem runner and historical artifacts.
