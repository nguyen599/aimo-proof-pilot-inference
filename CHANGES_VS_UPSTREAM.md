# Changes on the `docker/container-improvements` branch vs Geremie's upstream

Master list of every change this branch makes on top of Geremie Yeo's harness
(`bogoconic1/aimo-proof-pilot-inference`, forked at `main`). Each behavior change
has a **config knob** and defaults to the gold-standard (Yi-Chia Chen's Kaggle
solution) behavior; blatant bug fixes are always on. Deeper rationale for the
parser and self-eval items lives in [`evaluation/PARSING_VS_GOLD.md`](evaluation/PARSING_VS_GOLD.md).

## Behavior knobs (all under `search:` in the config)

| Knob | Default | What it changes vs upstream | Gold standard |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verifier_sees_self_evaluation` | `true` | Feed the prover's self-eval **text** into the verifier prompt. | `true` — gold (Kaggle + training) feeds it; in-distribution. |
| `refiner_sees_self_evaluation` | `false` | Feed the parent self-eval into the refiner bundle. Upstream fed it; we drop it. | `false` — gold's Kaggle inference drops it (self-score ~92% "1", noise). |
| `refine_parents` | `4` | Parents merged per refine call (was 1). Stratified random from the top-`top_proofs` pool. | `4` = gold's `refine_inputs`. |
| `reviews_per_refine_parent` | `3` | Reviews per parent in the bundle (was 1). | `3` = gold's `verify_k` (gold includes all ≤3). |
| `refine_review_strategy` | `random_nonideal` | Which reviews: `random_nonideal` (seeded random, score<1, varied per call) or `worst` (Geremie's deterministic lowest-scoring, may include ideal). | — (a design choice; gold uses *all* reviews) |
| `lenient_parsing` | `true` | Gold search-based extraction (recover missing `</solution>`, tolerate surrounding text, ignore tag case, allow empty self-eval/suggestions) vs upstream's strict whole-document `fullmatch`. | `true` — gold parses leniently; the OPD model omits `</solution>`. |

Each is validated as the right type by the strict schema (`eval_config.py`) and
present in both `config.yaml` and `config-dynamic.yaml`.

## Deployment changes (config values / env — also effectively knobs)

| Change | Where | Knob / override | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto data-parallel width** | `config.yaml` `model.data_parallel_size` | `auto` (derive from GPU count) or an explicit int | `4` in `config.yaml`; `auto` in `config-dynamic.yaml` |
| **fp8 KV cache** | `model.kv_cache_dtype` | `fp8_e4m3` / `auto` (bf16) / `fp8_e5m2` | `auto` (bf16) in `config.yaml`; `fp8_e4m3` in `config-dynamic.yaml` |
| **Triton attention (Blackwell sm120)** | `server.attention_backend: triton` | `fa3` (Hopper) / `fa4` / `triton` (sm120) | fa3; triton in `config-blackwell.yaml`. launch_server auto-sets `FLASHINFER_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` (9.0a Hopper / 12.0f Blackwell) + `--triton-attention-num-kv-splits 32` |
| **SGLang runtime baked into the image** | `Dockerfile` (multi-stage) | build args `RUNTIME_HF_REPO`/`RUNTIME_HF_REVISION`/`RUNTIME_ARCHIVE_SHA256`; `--secret id=hf_token` at build | venv downloaded + sha256-verified + relocated + deps-installed at build, frozen at `/opt/pp` |
| **Dropped hardcoded `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`** | `Dockerfile` | — (derived from `tp*dp`) | required for auto-dp; no knob |

`config-dynamic.yaml` is a **new profile** for sub-8-GPU nodes (auto-dp + fp8 KV);
`config-blackwell.yaml` is a **new profile** for 8× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm120,
no NVLink): triton attention (the only sink-correct backend on sm120), TP=2/auto-dp,
fp8 KV, **DFlash off** (see note). `config.yaml` stays byte-faithful to upstream's
8×H200 topology except for the knobs above defaulting to gold.

**Blackwell + DFlash limitation:** DFlash needs a triton draft backend on sm120,
but the DFlash ring worker (`dflash_worker_v2_ring.py`) hard-requires fa3/fa4 for
the draft, and Yi-Chia's triton-capable draft is TP=1-only. So TP=2 + DFlash +
triton is supported by no existing code path; `config-blackwell.yaml` runs without
speculation. Enabling it would require a triton-capable TP-sharded ring worker
(new work, unvalidated).

## Blatant bug fixes (always on, no knob)

| Fix | Why it's a bug, not a policy |
|---|---|
| **Float score parsing** — `<score>1.0</score>` / `0.0` accepted (`math.isclose` to {0,0.5,1}) | Upstream's literal regex rejected `1.0`, discarding the whole proof over a trailing `.0`. Applies in **both** parsing modes. |

(The empty-verifier-`<suggestions>` acceptance is part of `lenient_parsing`, not a
standalone always-on fix, since strict mode deliberately re-imposes the full
structure.)

## Refinement topology

The refinement changed from "one parent × its single worst review" to
"`refine_parents` stratified-random parents × `reviews_per_refine_parent` reviews
each". Counts, parent selection, and review strategy are all configurable:
`refine_parents`, `reviews_per_refine_parent`, and `refine_review_strategy`
(`random_nonideal` default, or `worst` for Geremie's deterministic lowest-scoring
reviews). Parent selection is always stratified-random from the top-`top_proofs`
pool. Round width is unchanged (`proofs_per_round` refine calls per round). See
the refinement section of `PARSING_VS_GOLD.md`.

## Non-code / tooling additions (no behavior change)

- `install/` — host-side installer for running the runtime outside the container
  (immutable-FS nodes). Not shipped in the image (`.dockerignore`).
- `evaluation/PARSING_VS_GOLD.md`, this file — documentation.

## To reproduce upstream (Geremie) behavior for an A/B

Set, under `search:`:

```yaml
verifier_sees_self_evaluation: true    # already gold + upstream
refiner_sees_self_evaluation: true     # upstream fed it
lenient_parsing: false                 # upstream's strict parser
refine_parents: 1                      # single-parent refine
reviews_per_refine_parent: 1           # one review per parent
refine_review_strategy: worst          # upstream's lowest-scoring review
```

This restores upstream's single-parent, single-worst-review, strict-parse
refinement. The only residual difference is the float-score fix, which is a
blatant bug fix and always applies.
