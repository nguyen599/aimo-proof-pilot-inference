# DFlash generation-correctness contract

This branch tests whether DFlash changes what the target model generates. The
oracle is the same target checkpoint served **without speculative decoding**.
DFlash is the system under test; the target-only server is not a production
fallback.

## What “correct” means

For greedy decoding, a case passes only when the target-only and DFlash servers
return all of the following identically:

- every output token ID, in order;
- the number and position of generated tokens;
- the normalized finish reason (length, EOS, stop token, or stop string);
- the final result reconstructed from streaming chunks.

The comparison is intentionally stricter than checking decoded text or the
mathematical answer. A near-tied logit, a whitespace-only difference, or two
equivalent answers is still a failed exact-token test. Logit margins may explain
a failure, but never turn it into a pass.

For non-greedy decoding, matching the same seed across the two engines is not a
valid correctness requirement: ordinary and speculative decoding can consume
random numbers in different orders. The required property is instead that
DFlash preserves the target distribution. The suite therefore checks:

1. deterministic repeatability within each mode for a fixed seed;
2. diversity across seeds, to catch an accidentally greedy or frozen sampler;
3. two-sample distribution agreement at positions reached through speculative
   verification;
4. the acceptance-and-residual-sampling rule against an independent reference
   on synthetic distributions.

## Production configuration under test

The primary GPU run mirrors `submission-32b-fix4.ipynb` on this H200 host:

| Component | Setting |
|---|---|
| Target | exact GPTQ W4A16 `opd-32b-v33-s200-gptq-w4a16` |
| Draft | exact compressed-tensors int4-MLP DFlash draft |
| Target KV cache | FP8 E4M3 |
| Attention | Triton, stock GQA extend on H200 |
| Target attention | hybrid: 48 SWA-4096 layers and 16 full-attention layers |
| Draft attention | 8 SWA-512 layers with the compact KV ring enabled |
| Speculative block | 8 positions: current anchor plus up to 7 proposals |
| Radix cache | enabled in the production phase; explicitly exercised by repeats |
| Scheduler | overlap/spec-v2, continuous batching, CUDA graphs |

Both servers use the same target, tokenizer, attention backend, KV dtype,
context limit, sampling parameters, and scheduler shapes. The only intended
semantic difference is that one server has DFlash enabled.

## Coverage matrix

The test suite separates algorithmic invariants from end-to-end GPU behavior.

| Layer | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Verification rule | zero acceptance, first/middle/last rejection, all accepted, block sizes and batches, bonus-token placement |
| Commit/rollback | only the accepted prefix plus one target token is published; rejected speculative tail never leaks |
| Greedy differential | exact output IDs for short, normal, and long prompts and generations |
| Boundaries | around block 8, draft window 512, prefill chunk 2048, and target SWA window 4096 |
| Termination | max length, EOS/stop token, stop string, and speculative-step overshoot trimming |
| Streaming | monotonic chunks, final-stream/non-stream equivalence, exact cross-mode result |
| Prefix caching | cold requests, repeated radix hits, shared-prefix forks, cache flush, and cache-state reuse |
| Scheduling | single requests, native batches, concurrent mixed lengths, and repeated requests after rejection-heavy work |
| Sampling | production temperature/top-p, fixed-seed repeatability, and cross-mode distribution tests |
| Stress | generation past the 512-token draft ring and prompts/generations across SWA-4096 |

Every case records request parameters, prompt/output token counts, raw output
IDs, finish metadata, cache/speculative telemetry, timing, and the first mismatch
if one occurs. Console logs and the structured JSON result are committed with
the harness so failures remain auditable.

## Interpretation

“100%” in the result means **100% of the declared finite matrix passed**, not a
mathematical proof over every possible prompt and scheduler interleaving. The
pure verification tests cover the small acceptance state space exhaustively;
the two-engine runs then test that the real kernels, caches, scheduler, and
streaming layer implement those rules for the production configuration.

The final report must not claim success if a case was skipped, a server used a
different model/configuration, speculative telemetry proves DFlash was inactive,
or any exact greedy mismatch remains unresolved.
