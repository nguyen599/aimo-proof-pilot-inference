# Evaluation harness

The harness exposes one production path:

1. `eval_config.py` loads `nemotron_cascade2.yaml` with exact section keys and
   validates every serving, search, and grader value.
2. `launch_server.py` selects BF16 or Humming W4A8 target weights and independently
   enables DFlash, always using one TP2 SGLang server.
3. `validate_server.py` compares the live server, model metadata, runtime markers,
   and GPU state with the YAML before generation.
4. `run_proof_search.py` loads exactly the IDs in the supplied JSON manifest and
   runs the same proof-pool engine for every problem.
5. `proof_search.py` generates, verifies, ranks, refines, and checkpoints every
   call and proof. Its budgets are read directly from YAML.
6. `grade_proofs.py` grades the one selected proof per problem for the configured
   64 attempts and applies zero-veto aggregation.
7. `run_full_evaluation.py` pins inputs, performs the audits, and writes the final
   machine-readable and Markdown reports.

HTTP calls are issued once. Every raw response is appended and flushed before it
can affect a derived artifact. Existing successful records are resume
checkpoints; existing failed records terminate the resumed run. There are no
alternate prompts, request retries, model fallbacks, proof fallbacks, stub
graders, or synthetic scores.

The proof prompt files are copied byte-for-byte from ycchen's deployed Math-3R
pipeline at commit `bc03a2c71a076990deaad3d712c6889682e12c69`. The local code
uses ycchen's system/user split, XML output contract, and XML candidate bundle,
while the configurable multi-round search schedule follows the approved
Nemotron-Cascade-style evaluation design.
