"""Periodic upload of proof-search artifacts (reasoning traces) to a HF dataset.

The proof search writes a complete trace under the run's artifacts dir:
`problems/<id>/calls.jsonl` (every model call, with `reasoning_content` and
`content`), plus `prompts/`, `proofs/`, `rounds/` and `final.json`. This module
snapshots that whole tree to a HuggingFace dataset on a fixed interval and once
more at shutdown, so a long run's traces are durably captured as it goes.

Uploads go through `upload_large_folder`, which splits a big tree into many
commits and is resumable -- a single all-at-once `upload_folder` commit stalls
(HTTP 413 / "large folder" rejection) once a run's `calls.jsonl` grows to
hundreds of MB. `upload_large_folder` has no `path_in_repo`, so we hardlink-
mirror the artifacts under a per-run staging dir (`<run_out>/.hf_stage/<run_name>/`)
and upload that, keeping each run namespaced. The judge-facing `submission.csv`
(written OUTSIDE the artifacts dir, atomically rewritten each round -> a folder
mirror of it goes stale) is uploaded explicitly with `upload_file`, which always
commits current content.

Auth comes from a secrets file (JSON or YAML) that is NOT the config and never
leaves the node -- the config only stores its path. Upload failures are logged
and swallowed: a flaky network must never kill a multi-hour proof run.
