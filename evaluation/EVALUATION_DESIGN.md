# Nemotron-style IMO 2025 evaluation design

## Scope

The active problem source is the six-record `MathArena/imo_2025` dataset. The
approved debug run selects exactly problem `1`, the sunny-lines problem. This
dataset change does not alter serving, prompts, search, selection, or final
GPT-5.6 Sol aggregation.

`configs/nemotron_cascade2.yaml` remains the only configuration. There are no
difficulty-specific configurations or problem-dependent budget branches.

## Serving modes

All modes use one SGLang server with tensor parallelism 2 across both H200 GPUs,
FA4 target attention, 128-token KV pages, BF16 KV cache, radix prefix caching,
overlap scheduling, and CUDA graphs. DFlash modes also require FA4 draft
attention. SGLang does not support deterministic inference with FA4, so this
branch deliberately uses the FlashInfer sampling backend selected by SGLang.
Two independent YAML booleans provide four supported modes:

| Quantized target | DFlash | Mode |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| false | false | BF16 target-only default |
| true | false | Humming W4A8 target-only |
| false | true | BF16 target with BF16 DFlash draft |
| true | true | Humming W4A8 target with quantized DFlash draft |

No mode is selected automatically after failure. The live server must exactly
match YAML or preflight terminates.

FA4 requires `mem_fraction_static=0.82` here. Its 128-token pages disable the
page-1 DFlash draft ring, so the draft receives a full KV pool. A 0.84 fraction
left no execution headroom; 0.70 caused request retractions; 0.82 completed the
32-by-8,192 workload without retraction.

## Ycchen prompt contract

The active prover, verifier, and refiner templates are copied byte-for-byte from
`ycchen-tw/proof-pilot-codes` commit
`bc03a2c71a076990deaad3d712c6889682e12c69`. The code uses ycchen's system/user
split, strict XML outputs, and XML candidate bundle. The unused selector is not
copied because final selection is deterministic from verifier scores.

The IMO 2025 statement is substituted only into ycchen's existing `{problem}`
field. No MathArena-specific generation prompt or algorithm is used.

## Search algorithm

For each requested problem:

1. Generate 32 initial proofs using stable, distinct request seeds.
2. Parse each natural-stop response using ycchen's XML contract.
3. Verify every new proof independently 16 times using ycchen's verifier prompt,
   including the proof's self-evaluation.
4. Rank the cumulative verified pool by mean verifier score, self-score, and a
   stable seeded tie-breaker.
5. Unless the best mean exceeds `0.99999`, take the cumulative top 8 proofs.
6. For every selected parent, place eight informative verifier reviews into one
   ycchen XML candidate bundle and generate four independent refinements.
7. Verify all 32 new proofs 16 times, add them to the cumulative pool, rerank,
   and continue for at most four rounds.
8. Return the highest-ranked proof. There is no selector-model call or proof
   fallback.

Each full round makes 32 generation calls and 512 verifier calls. Four rounds
make at most 2,176 local calls per problem. Early stop
can reduce the count without changing the algorithm.

All independent continuations are admitted together, bounded only by the YAML
concurrency limit. The client does not serialize a full completion or issue a
synthetic request to prime the radix cache; prefix reuse is managed by SGLang.

## Persistence

Every call has a stable sample ID and seed. The runner flushes a lossless record
containing content, reasoning, finish reason, usage, cached-prefix tokens,
latency, prompt hash, and error before the call affects ranking. Full messages
are stored once in hash-addressed prompt files. Proofs, verifier sets, round
summaries, final selection, config, ID manifest, server validation, model hashes,
dataset hash, prompt hashes, and source commit are persisted.

Successful calls are resume checkpoints. A persisted failure is terminal. There
are no request retries, prompt fallbacks, model fallbacks, or synthetic scores.
The YAML also sets a strict 24-hour HTTP deadline for each local model response,
allowing full 262,144-token completions without imposing a shorter hidden client
deadline.

## Final grading

The existing aggregation policy remains unchanged: one selected proof is sent to
`gpt-5.6-sol` through the Responses API 64 times with high reasoning and SDK
retries disabled. Each
attempt returns strict JSON fields in `findings`, `grade`, `reasoning` order and
may assign any integer grade from 0 through 7 under the problem-specific marking
guidelines. If any grade is zero, that problem receives zero; otherwise its score
is the mean of all 64 attempts. This is our zero-veto protocol, not MathArena's
leaderboard judge ensemble.
